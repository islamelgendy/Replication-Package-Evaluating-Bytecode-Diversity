### Raw data
Here you can find the raw data used in our statistical analysis.

 - Data used for the research questions related to effectiveness and efficiency (RQ1 and RQ2, respectively): [RQ1-RQ2-EffectivenessEfficiencyResults.tsv](RQ1-RQ2-EffectivenessEfficiencyResults.tsv)
 - Data used for the research question related to scalability (RQ3): [RQ3-ScalabilityResults.tsv](RQ3-ScalabilityResults.tsv)
 - Detailed effectiveness and efficiency results per subject: [ResultsPerSubject.zip](results_per_subject.zip)
 - All the prioritized test suites per subject: [PrioritizedTestSuitesPerSubject.zip](prioritized_per_subject.zip)
